# NSW Crime Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project analyses crime data across New South Wales (NSW) to identify patterns and trends over time. Visualisations, including heatmaps, are used to represent crime rates across different Local Government Areas (LGAs).

## 📊 Data Source

- **NSW Recorded Crime Statistics**  
  Public dataset available via the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOCSAR).
